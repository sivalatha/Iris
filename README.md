## Description: 
1. Title: Iris Plants Database
2. Sources:
     (a) Creator: R.A. Fisher
     (b) Donor: Michael Marshall (MARSHALL%PLU@io.arc.nasa.gov)
     (c) Date: July, 1988

3. Relevant Information: This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. Predicted attribute: class of iris plant. This is an exceedingly simple domain. This data differs from the data presented in Fishers articlc (identified by Steve Chadwick,  spchadwick@espeedaz.net )
The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature.
The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features

4. Number of Instances: 150 (50 in each of three classes)

5. Number of Attributes: 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

6. Attribute Information:
   1. sepal length in cm
   2. sepal width in cm
   3. petal length in cm
   4. petal width in cm
   5. class: 
      -- Iris Setosa
      -- Iris Versicolour
      -- Iris Virginica
